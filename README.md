# hackman 
Hangman game and project created for the Clemson CPSC Discord Hackman challenge!

## NOTE
In order to run this, you must have a key.txt file in the same directory with your API key.

## Programmer's Aside
Things I Learned:
- True Python OOP: I had to use classes to create the window and multiple files, was very interesting, I don't think I like it better than Java/C++
- Qt: GUI framework primarily for C++, but also used in other languages, this helped a lot
and was very streamlined, so I'll definitely continue to use it
- API Requests: Simple concepts, just a few lines of code, but good that I can do it in Python

Things I Wanted to Add:
- Difficulty Levels: Have hard/medium/easy and corresponding properties for each, just didn't get
the time to implement it
- Music/Animation: Make a full game with more UX, not easy to do in Qt as it is strictly GUI,
but I then again I wanted to learn just GUI and not necessarily game design
- AI: I wanted to try and learn basic AI fundamentals to get a hangman game solver up and running,
but ended up not getting time to learn it as I focused on Qt

Things I Need to Work On:
- Organization: I need to work on better class system organization, with a clearer design in mind
before starting on these projects
- Drawing: :slightly_smiling_face:
- Learn More Qt: I would like to learn more Qt in depth with QML/C++ Qt/PyQt so that I can design
better GUIs from scratch, as opposed to jumping in from nothing
- Using More Generalized Variables: In this there were a lot of repeated strings/functionality that 
should've been more streamlined, so I will try to improve that moving forward on bigger projects
- More Efficient Code: This program as it is now is very slow, so in the future I need to work on 
making my programs more efficient (goes along with point above)
