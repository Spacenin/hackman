# hackman 
Hangman game and project created for the Clemson CPSC Discord Hackman challenge!

Things I Learned:
- True Python OOP: I had to use classes to create the window and multiple files, was very interesting, I don't think I like it better than Java/C++
- Qt: GUI framework primarily for C++, but also used in other languages, this helped a lot
and was very streamlined, so I'll definitely continue to use it
- API Requests: Simple concepts, just a few lines of code, but good that I can do it in Python

Things I Wanted to Add:
- Difficulty Levels: Have hard/medium/easy and corresponding properties for each, just didn't get
the time to implement it
- Music/Animation: Make a full game with more UX, not easy to do in Qt as it is strictly GUI,
but I then again I wanted to learn just GUI and not necessarily game design
